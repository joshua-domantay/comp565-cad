# COMP 565 - Computer-Aided Design Software in Virtual Reality
COMP 565 Advanced Computer Graphics group project. This Unity projects serves as a visualization for utilizing virtual reality with structural engineering. In other words, a computer-aided design software but in virtual reality. This allows a more immersive experience by providing a realistic representation of structures and objects.

## Features
Main menu for easy access to the application's settings and functionalities.<br>
![Main menu image](https://github.com/joshua-domantay/comp565-cad/blob/main/README%20assets/comp565_menu.png?raw=true)<br>
Spawn blocks (cuboids) and wedges with various wood textures to choose from. User can set the length of a wood block before spawning it in the scene.<br>

Allows modifictaion to objects in scene, such as position, rotation, and length. Before setting new length to a block, it shows a visual of the resulting change. Also allows removal of objects from the scene.<br>
